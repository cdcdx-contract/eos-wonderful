Blockchain and our Mission
--------------------------
Wonderful platforms make use of block chains to create a better platform for small verseinesses.
We have devised the EOS Wonderful Solution to efficiently solve the many problems encountered in the effort to create a real-life dApp.

The reason that the current block-chain ecosystem's real-life adapts are absent is due to performance and commissions.
Even the EOS, the only public chain that actually has a usable speed, is too expensive to create for real-life use. On the other hand, investors with accounts have no choice but to waste their resources.

To solve this problem, we have built an EOS WonderPool that can use the EOS chain without an account. EOS Wonderful aims to be an open ecosystem that communicates with the community and understands and believes in the potential of open source ecosystems. That's why we will share all the methods and knowledge and try to accommodate the opinions and capabilities of other developers.

The EOS-Wonderful Ecosystem
---------------------------
### The three components of the EOS Wonderful ecosystem

**1. Multi-verse smartcontract**
```
The developer of the dApp can implement a multi-verse that adds new functions directly.
It can also be connected to other multi-verses or share data.
You can share your account information by connecting to the main Multiverse on the Wonderful platform.
```


**2. Resources and compensation**
```
A person with an EOS account can earn commission reimbursement by mining transactions from someone else who does not have an EOS account.
Investors who are wasting too much resources can contribute to the Wisdom of EOS with their resources and get rewards.
```


**3. Free participation**
```
Multi-verse concert allows you to implement not only the transmission of tokens, but also all functions such as decentralized exchanges and games that can be implemented as smart contours.
Create a real-life dumb through EOS Wonders, a community-driven force.
```

### EOS Wonderful Participants
**1. Wonderful platform**
```
It is the developer of the EOS who is always working for the development of community and EOS Wonderful.
```
**2. dApp developer**
```
EOS is a developer who creates an dApp that works through Wonderful.
You can build a multi-verse dApp with new functions and work with the main multi-verse to create an eco-system with a good coin to create an effective import model.
By making a dive, you will contribute greatly to the value of EOS Wonderfulness.
```
**3. Contributors**
```
All users participating in the EOS Wonderful ecosystem are contributors.
EOS Users who use the droids made with the wonders,
For those who do not have an account, a miner who gets compensation by sharing the remaining resources,
From developers contributing to the development of EOS Wonderful,
The contributor of EOS Wonderful is you who read this article.
```

Token Economy
-------------
### Problems and Solutions
The traditional EOS had to go through a complex account creation process and allocate resources to use the account in order to actually use it. For that reason, based on the number of scatters installed, the total number of users who can actually participate was about 30,000, which means that the market could not be secured as much as the people expected for the block chain.

On the wonder platform, we decided to abandon decentralization for the development of real-life dApps and judge that the duties of the private chain were not making good use of the block chain.
I think that EOS Wonderful was born after I thought about how to increase the accessibility of users and reduce the cost burden while maintaining the existing decentralization.


EOS Wonderful Economy
EOS Wonderful is a new mainnet platform. The ecosystem of EOS Wonderful is made up of developers who use real dApps, miners who provide the resources that users need to use them, and dApps.

In the past, developers had to pay a few thousand won per account to provide a block chain dApp. In addition, entry barriers due to too low accessibility were not enough to make the available dumb in the real world. With EOS Wonderful, developers can significantly reduce their dumb maintenance costs by at least 1/15. The more users there are, the more the gap goes. EOS Wonderful also adopts a key-account approach rather than an EOS account, so you can use the dApp immediately without complicated procedures. This allows the dApp under development to have a common app-level UX. The dApp created on the EOS Wonders is open source, so you can implement your own token, but you can also use coins from the main network.

Users of EOS Wonderful can not create transactions alone, because they do not have accounts and resources. You can send a transaction with the allowance of the miner by setting the amount of the fee you are willing to pay and asking the miner. The miner will receive a commission when checking the commission of the requested transaction and issuing it in his name. Because there are many users in the EOS ecosystem who have staked a lot of coins and resources for investment purposes, they are motivated to work as miners. The more you dig up, the more you will be able to handle the EOS Wonders.

Technology Architecture
-----------------------

EOS Wonderful is made up of four layers.
1. parasitism-murtiverse
```
EOS Wonderful network of EOS running on top. EOS Because of parasitism in the chain, it has about the performance or decentralization of EOS main net.
It consists of the main network provided by the wonder platform and the multi-verse network operated by the dApp developers.
In the main network, there is a good coin which is used as a commission and used as the center of the token model.
Ad developers can use the Wonderful Coin, the main network, in their own multi-verse network.
```
2. EOS-Wonderful Protocol
```
It is a protocol for implementing communication between multi-verse networks and data sharing, communication between multi-verse and dab, communication with miners, wallet, smart track.
```
3. EOS-Wonderful Framework
```
It is designed to develop the dApp using a multi-verse network designed for the protocol.
```
4. dApp
```
It is the dApp made through the EOS Wonderful framework.
```
